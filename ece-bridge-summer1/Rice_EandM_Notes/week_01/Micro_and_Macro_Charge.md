# Electric Charge

## Static Electricity

When materials are rubbed together, charges can be separated, particularly if one material has a greater affinity for electrons than another.

Both the amber and cloth are originally neutral with equal positive and negative charges, when rubbed together, a tiny fraction of negative charge is transferred to the amber, leaving the cloth with a net positive charge.

The English Physicist William Gilbert (1544 - 1603) studied this force, using various substances.

He determined that metals never exhibit this phenomenon, but minerals did. (Metals can be charged, but in this scenario i.e., rubbing they don't retain charge well, likely because they conduct and quickly lose it to their surroundings).

Also, although an electrified amber rod attracts a piece of fur, it would repel another 
electrified amber rod.

This suggested there were two types of electric property, one drawn to the other. This 
property was eventually called electric charge.

The difference between these two types of electric charge is in the direction of electric forces that each type of charge causes (+ / -), opposite charges attract, like charges repel. This interaction is described by **Coulomb's Law".

The SI unit of electric charge is the **Coulomb (C)**.

## Electric Force Observations
- The force acts without physical contact between two objects.
- The force can be either attractive or repulsive: if two interacting objects carry the same sign of charge, the force is repulsive; if the charges are of opposite sign, the force is attractive. These interactions are referred to as **electrostatic repulsion** and **electrostatic attraction**, respectively.
- Not all objects are affected by this force.
- The magnitude of the force decreases (rapidly) with increasing distance between the objects.

## Properties of Electric Charge
In addition to the existence of two types of charge, several other properties have been discovered.
- **Charge is quantized** - This means that electric charge comes in discrete amounts, and there us a smallest possible amount of charge that an object can have. In the SI system the smallest amount is e = 1.602 x 10^19 C. No free particle can have less charge than this, and, therefore, the charge on any object - the charge on all objects - must be an integer multiple of this amount. All macroscopic, charged objects have charge because electrons have either been added or taken away from them, resulting in a net charge.
- **The magnitude of the charge is independent of the type**. Phrased another way, the smallest possible positive charge (to four significant figures) is +1.602 x 10^19 C, and the smallest possible negative charge is -1602 x 10^19 C; these values are exactly equal. This is simply how the laws of Physics in our universe turned out.
- **Charge is conserved**. Charge can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred from place to place, from one object to another. Frequently, we speak of two charges "cancelling"; this is verbal shorthand. It means that if two objects that have equal and opposite charges are physically close to each other, then the (oppositely directed) forces they apply on some other other charged object cancel, for a net force of zero. It is important that you understand that the charges on the objects by no means disappear, however. The net charge of the universe is constant.
- **Charge is conserved in closed systems**. In principle, if a negative charge disappeared from your lab bench and reappeared on the Moon, conservation of charge would still hold. However, this never happens. If the total you have in your local system on your lab bench is changing, there will be a measurable flow of charge into or out of the system. Again, charges can and do move around, and their effects can and do cancel, but the next charge in your local environment (if closed) is conserved. The last two items are both referred to as the **law of conservation of charge**.
